        <p>Hi I'm Haley and I'm old enough to have owned and opperated a cassette tape player<sup>TM</sup>. 
            I'm doing my undergrad in CS and I'm thinking about doing a life sentence in medicine. I can build 
            computers and shoot 3s(albeit poorly). I have no real experience in web development except the one 
            time I changed the cursor for a blog into a flower. However this course is genuinely interesting 
            and has reminded me why I love learning so much. This is my cat BK (Baby Kitty). She is a brat.
